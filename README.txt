IMPLEMENTATION
The project has been implemented as a web-based 'simulation'
of the real-world system for demo purposes.

CONTENTS
The project folder includes HTML, CSS, JS and PHP files.

REQUIREMENTS/RUN:
In order to run the program/demo it on your own system, you will need:
- To preview the app, you may simply open index.html with any web browser
- Graphics and javascript timer functionality will be working normally

FOR TEXT MESSAGING / ALERT / ADD TIME FUNCTIONALITY 
IMPORTANT:
- DO NOT delete addme.txt
- A server capable of running PHP scripts (LAMP/WAMP setup suffices)
- Functioning PHP mail() function (you may need to install/enable sendmail on a Unix machine)

- Simply place all the files on the server the application should work!
- You may need to edit the 'domain' ('From' email address) provided in the text.php file.
